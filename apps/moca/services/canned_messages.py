We are excited you chose us to help you identify the ideal physical therapist(s) to meet your needs. We want to provide a few tips to assist with the use of our application. 
In order for a therapist to provide a best-in-class experience, it’s best to identify your area of pain in the dashboard prior to searching for therapists.
Do you have multiple areas of pain? No problem! You can either select multiple areas to inform your treatment plan.  
Using filter options to target ideal pricing, date(s), and area(s) of pain will help identify the ideal therapist for you.
  If you are having trouble finding a therapist, remove filters to expand your options.  
Feel free to reach out to therapists directly if you are not sure what type of therapist and/or treatment you will need. They will be able to answer your questions and assist you in developing a specialized treatment plan.
All session transactions will proceed once the therapy session begins; please be sure to add payment information before your first session.
If you have any questions, please contact us at hello@joinmoca.com and one of our customer service personnel will reach out to you within 24 hours. 
We look forward to serving you on your road to improvement,
